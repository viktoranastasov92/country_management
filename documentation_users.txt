Country Manager - Documentation For Users

This API provides the ability to manage country data which includes :
	- creation of new countries
	- editing existing countries
	- searching for countries via given criterias
	- deleting countries
The country information is coming from data providers and every data provider is independent from the others
	in terms of the country identifier in its system.
When a new country is created, the data needed is the provider identifier and the country identifier in its
	system and also the country name and abbreviation. Validations take place for the abbreviation that consists of 3 letters.
When an existing country is updated it can be identified either with an identifier from the "Country manager"
	system or with the identifier it has from a specific provider - along with the provider identifier itself.
The same applies when we want to delete a country - with the above-mentioned two ways to identify a country
	and to remove it from the system.
Searching for existing countries can be done by several search options (which are all applied when searching) :
	- list of identifiers from the "Country manager" system
	- country name
	- country abbreviation
	- provider data - country identifier in the provider and the provider identifier itself
	The search result consists of pages where we have the current page number, number of pages,
		the size of a page and total number of countries that are found using the provided search filter.
